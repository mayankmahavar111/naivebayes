the cutout and button be place perfectly 
I love be able to use one headset for both by land line and cell

I can hear while I be drive in the car and usually do not even have to put it on it be loudest setting 
seller ship quickly and much cheaper than the competitor 
good show Samsung 
so I buy about 10 of these and save a lot of money 
Leopard print be wonderfully wild

cool phone 
Works good 
Motorola finally get the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 
but it be great i would really recommend it 
the headset fulfil my requirement so I be happy with my purchase 
I like the fact that it rest lightly against you ear rather than inside 
a lot of website have be rating this a very good phone and so do I 
I have try these cable with my computer and my ipod and it work just fine 
it be easy to turn on and off when you be in the car and the volume control be quite accessable 
I have have mine for about a year and this Christmas I buy some for the rest of the family 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 
nice leather 
it be a joy to use 
very satisifed with that 
just read on the spec alone make you say WOW 
love it great armband 
I really like this product over the Motorola because it be allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 
I exchange the sony ericson z500a for this and I be pretty happy with that decision 
I be very impressed with the price of the case 
also make it easier to hold on to 
I use this product in a motor control center where there be a lot of high voltage hum from the equipment and it work great 
it be pretty easy 
beautiful styling though 
excellent product 
it be the best charger I have see on the market yet 
sweetest phone 
oh the charger seem to work fine 
it fit so securely that the ear hook do not even need to be use and the sound be better direct through you ear canal 
the best scene in the movie be when Gerardo be try to find a song that keep run through he head 
see the movie today and think it be a good effort good message for kid 
love the casting of Jimmy Buffet as the science teacher 
and those baby owl be adorable 
the movie show a lot of Florida at it be best make it look very appealing 
the song be the best and the Muppets be so hilarious 
it be so cool 
this be a very right on case movie that deliver everything almost right in you face 
this review be long overdue since I consider a tale of two sister to be the single greatest film ever make 
I will put this gem up against any movie in term of screenplay cinematography act post production editing direct or any other aspect of film make 
it be practically perfect in all of they a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpiece 
the structure of this film be easily the most tightly construct in the history of cinema 
I can think of no other film where something vitally important occur every other minute 
in other word the content level of this film be enough to easily fill a dozen other film 
how can anyone in they right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 
it be quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 
yes this film do require a rather significant amount of puzzle solve but the piece fit together to create a beautiful picture 
this be the number one best th game in the series 
it deserve strong love 
it be a insane game 
there be massive level massive unlockable character it be just a massive game 
Waste you money on this game 
this be the kind of money that be waste properly 
actually the graphic be good at the time 
as they say in Canada this be the fun game aye 
this game rock 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 
it be pure brilliance 
the film succeed despite or perhaps because of a obviously meagre budget 
I be glad the film do not go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 
in addition to have one of the most lovely song ever write french cancan also boast one of the cutest lead lady ever to grace the screen 
it be hard not to fall head over heel in love with that girl 
excellent cast story line performance 
totally believable 
Anne Heche be utterly convincing 
Sam Shepard 's portrayal of a gung ho Marine be sobering 
I sit rivet to the tv screen 
all in all I give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 
I do think Tom Hanks be a good actor 
I enjoy read this book to my child when they be little 
there be some generally great thing in it 
the suspense builder be good just cross the line from g to pg 
I especially like the non cliche choice with the parent in other movie I could predict the dialog verbatim but the write in this movie make better selection 
if you want a movie that be not gross but give you some chill this be a great choice 
Alexander Nevsky be a great film 
he be a amazing film artist one of the most important whoever live 
this if the first movie I have give a 10 to in year 
if there be ever a movie that need word of mouth to promote this be it 
overall the film be interesting and think provoke 
plus it be well paced and suit its relatively short run time 
give this one a look 
I give it a 10 
the wind and the Lion be well write and superbly act 
it be a true classic

here in the wind and the Lion we see a wonderful rendering of America 's own Imperial age 
what make this story different be the terrific production value faultless photography composition and editing the terrific cast the underappreciated Brian Keith play a bully Teddy and vivid history 
though the wind and the Lion be tell largely through the eye of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the character whether it be Sean Connery 's noble brigand Candace Bergen 's feisty heroine John Huston 's wily John Hay or Steve Kanaly 's spiffy radiant ruthless can do lieutenant Roosevelt 's big Stick 
this be high adventure at its best 
I think it be Robert Ryans best film because he portray someone like my father and he be a schizophrenic in real life my father although he never murder anyone but be affect more so during the second world war which make he worse

still it be the set that get a big 10 on my oy vey scale 
both do good job and be quite amusing 
I like Armand Assante my cable company 's summary sound interesting so I watch it twice already and probably will again 
I believe the screenwriter do a good job of tie up the loose end 
my 8 10 score be mostly for the plot 
I will not say any more I do not like spoiler so I do not want to be one but I believe this film be worth you time 
I be deeply impressed with the character he play 
I know when I see the film that more great thing be to come from this gifted actor

I have see many movie star Jaclyn Smith but my god this be one of she best though it come out 12 year ago 
this movie contain a all star cast and what I love the most be that it open my eye to see other actor who I have not see before 
this movie be kind of long in length but I enjoy every minute of it 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 1 10 scale 
totally different with load of understatement and black comedy this be a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 
this movie create its own universe and be fascinating in every way 
but this movie really get to I 
see it 
I really hope the team behind this movie make more movie and that they will continue to do so in they own some kinda weird style 
and I forget the cast here i superb with Trond Fausa Aurv g be perfect in the role as the bothersome man who do not understand where he be what he be do and why 
this movie be a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 
I find this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 
initially the local site in the film which be film here in Buffalo intrigue I 
later I find myself lose in the power of the film 
the entire audience applaud at the conclusion of the film 
I leave the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race

STEAMBOAT WILLIE be a amazingly important film to we cinema history 
this second appearance of Mickey Mouse follow the silent plane crazy earlier that year be probably he most famous film mostly because it be so ground breaking 
while you do not yet hear Mickey speak there be ton of sound effect and music throughout the film something we take for grant now but which be a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 
however after see the short again after about 25 year I be amaze at how timeless the film actually be 
it be just adorable see Mickey play Turkey in the Straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 
clever and a real crowd pleaser this film still rank among Mickey 's best film even after 80 wonderful year 
the original body and soul 1947 be a masterpiece 
John Garfield Ann revere Lilli Plmer William Conrad Canada Lee and film by one of the greatest cinematographer to ever grace the screen James Wong Howe 
okay I like to consider myself a fair critic so I will give credit where credit 's due the creature effect be actually pretty cool 
Got ta love those close up of slimy drool tooth 
the film 's sole bright spot be Jonah Hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fan of the recent Superbad due to the amount of weight he lose in the interim 
be a 90 's child I truly enjoy this show and I can proudly say that I enjoy it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoon 
but Tiny Toons keep the 90 's vibe and deliver one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoon ever create 
the memory be murky but I can only say that I enjoy every single episode and product related to the show 
easily none other cartoon make I laugh in a tender way before get into dark sitcom orient for teenager 
the character be all funny and have the peculiarity of not have a true lead character 
every single character be hilarious and deserve to be call a lead 
Perabo have a nice energy level and be obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 
I believe that Pitch Black be do well 
the character be interesting and you want to find out more about they the longer the movie go on and I think people will be surprise by who do and do not make it 
go watch it 
very funny 
the character be interesting and you really care for they 
a instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the end credit 
do not miss it 
this be a masterful piece of film make with many theme simmer and occasionally boil over in this wart and all study of the poet 's bohemian self indulgent wartime year that span the aerial bombardment of London and the outward tranquillity of a Welsh coastal retreat the borderline between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concern jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and self sacrifice and more 
a mature subtle script that suggest and occasionally bring into dramatic focus the underlie tension be well serve by perfect performance apart from the odd inappropriate smile that Keira Knightley be prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other character themselves often mention it 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of close up camera angle and lighting include pointillistic faux home movie footage be a wonder and joy to behold 
it be as continuously beautiful to look at as a Bertolucci but the relationship here be more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that master 's work 
I see this film over Christmas and what a great film it be 
I think Errol Flynn be brilliant as Custer and have since become my favourite actor 
he act alongside Olivia De Havilland be brilliant and the end be fantastic 
I have always know that Errol Flynn be a brilliant actor as he be my dad favourite actor and I grow up watch he film as a child 
but it be not until I watch this film that I realise how great he actually be 
I will give this film 10 out of 10 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lot of nice shenanigan surround a murder spy a kidnap child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermist 
Jimmy Stewart be as ever a great hero for Hitchcock the story rip along to its cool climax at a embassy function but it lack the brooding menace of Hitchcock 's black and white low budget original 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great master 's stable 
I have to say that this film be excellently produce and top the rating as a typical sci fi film 
excellently produce by one of Sci fi 's best producer Scot Vandiver 
but it be entertaining nonetheless 
it be a campy sort of film that be a joy to watch 
there be barely a boring moment in the film and there be plenty of humorous part 
the cast be always entertaining as usual 
overall a delight 
this movie do a excellent job of reveal the complexity of the task and the incredible challenge face South Africa 
I believe every one should see this movie as I think few people outside of South Africa understand its past and what be be attempt in the truth and Reconciliation process 
nothing short of magnificent photography cinematography in this film 
the acting be fantastic the story be seamlessly weave together and the dog be splendid a must rent view or see 
do not be afraid of subtitle its worth a little aversion therapy 10 10 
excellent performance 
there still be good actor around 
also great directing and photography 
very true to Shakespear and a ` must ' for all Shakespear fan 
Macbeth Jason Connery move I to tear with he final monolog out brief candle out he give the sphere of moral decay and dark force a human face which make it the more interesting 
Helen Baxendale be a very credible lady Macbeth who can be very cheerfull at time and sometimes she just look like a naughty girl but deadly in she taste for blood and evil 
if you love death and decay and Shakespears lyric this be the one 
this be a witty and delightful adaptation of the Dr Seuss book brilliantly animated by UPA 's finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 
special mention should be make of the superb music score and sound effect which be a integral element in help to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 
however Paul Schrader have indeed make a film about Mishima that be both superb complex 
also notable be John Bailey 's fine crisp beautifully color cinematography and the great production design costume by Eiko Ishioka who go on to do the memorable costume for Coppola 's Dracula for which she receive a well deserve Oscar 
if you do watch it however there be small consolation the actress play Anne 's sister each do a wonderful job with they role 
this be a stunning movie 
raw and sublimely move 
it feel like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually get from watch people on a stage which play on everyone 's terror of a white lie escalate to monstrous consequence 
all of the main player be mesmerise 
Tom Wilkinson break my heart at the end and everyone else 's judge by the amount of fumble for hankie and hand go up to face among male and female alike 
Julian Fellowes have triumph again 
he be a national treasure 
go and see it 
this be a excellent film 
the aerial scene be well do 
it be also the right balance of war and love 
the film give mean to the phrase never in the history of human conflict have so much be owe by so many to so few

Stanwyck and Morgan be perfectly cast in what be in many way a modern equivalent of Dickens ' Christmas Carol in its sensibility 
the success of the film depend on the casting of Sydney Greenstreet as the Alexander Yardley character 
the attractive set use throughout most of the film be a eye please gem 
the transfer be very good 
very nice and relaxing late night view

I just see this film and I recommend it 
it have a very good plot it hold you complete attention the acting be superb Tom Wilkinson be fantastic and Emily Watson be also very good 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 
Tom Wilkinson 's character be a man who be not prepare for the ordeal that be about to begin but he take the matter in hand as the story progress and this great actor give a performance that make you feel the character 's anguish and suffering 
Emily Watson 's character be very strong and she have only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 
despite the pan of reviewer I like this movie 
in fact I like it better than Interview with a Vampire and I like this Lestat Stuart Townsend better than cruise 's attempt 
Aailiyah be pretty good as Akasha in place compelling she first entrance and mini dance scene 
I be a big fan of this series mostly due to anne Rice 's style sensitivity and treatment 
I guess I like the detail of he dysfunction he be believable 
but I think he acting be skilled 
Meredith m be better than all right 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 
it be rare when a film maker take the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that do not fall into the trap of be overly syrupy or over indulgent 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 
this early film from future goremeister Lucio Fulci be a very good addition to the giallo sub genre 
this be one of the best italian thriller of the early 70 's 
a standout scene 
Technically the film be well make with impressive camera work solid acting and effective music from Riz Ortolani particularly good be a recur unaccompanied female vocal that sound like it be come from a distant hill 
it be still wild stuff though and be highly recommend to fan of giallo cinema 
the movie be very interesting from begin to the end 
I like the way Dustin Hoffman 's character be ready to do just about everything to stay with he son 
this movie be also reveal 
personally I think it show that people should learn to find a compromise they self without involve other people into issue 
PS the only scene in the movie that be cool be when the central character find she room blow up 
it be a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 
a italian reviewer call this a small great film and that be right 
all the actor give a wonderful performance especially Jennifer Rubin as Jamie Harris who change from the nervous starlet in the begin through the strange event she be part of to the cool star 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotion of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 
the movie in movie situation in the beginning and through the game that be play with she by the act coach be fascinating 
also the music by Mark Snow be possibly the best score I have ever hear 
you will not forget this movie 
I see it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it be the stranger and I love it 
but the duet between the astronaut and he doctor at the beginning of the movie be a perfect exchange if one consider that this movie be make well into the Cold War and the astronaut 's biggest fear be that he have crash in the USSR 
this movie be so awesome 
I love it it be really scary 
I love the Scream movie and all horror movie and this one rank way up there 
if you want a real scare rent this one 
this be a extraordinary film 
as a courtroom drama it be compelling as a indictment on the american justice system it be frightening 
the film be well paced understate and one of the best courtroom documentary I have see 
this mostly routine fact base tv drama get a boost from the fine performance by Cole 
it be clear that she have the range and ability to pull off this part 
she carry the movie well 
Constantine give everything the right intensity and seem to have a good understanding of the underlie psychological motivation 
it be wonderful and inspiring to watch and I hope that it get release again on to video or dvd 
edit the editing of this film be phenomenal in my opinion 
when a song could explain the emotion of the subject better such as when Jay Adams ' unfortunate life be a subject of talk the song old man by Neil Young be play which evoke many emotion 
Cinematography The film be shoot in a interesting way 
of course the footage from the 70s be grainy but that only enhance the film 
this film offer many delight and surprise 
when Achille and Philippa beautifully sing a duet from Don Giovanni that perfectly describe they situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layer of this excellent film 
the story unfold in 18th century jutland and the use of period music play on period instrument be just one more fine touch 
you share general Loewenhielm 's exquisite joy in he partaking of the Cailles en Sarcophage even though you be just watch a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 
but this understate film leave a lasting impression 
the warmth it generate be in contrast to its austere backdrop 
you will leave the theater want to go out and dance under the star 
the act as you would expect from this cast be top notch 
the character be flesh out surprisingly well particularly Grimes and Blake and all the actor deliver they sharply script line with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 
Angus Scrimm also turn in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violin play anatomist Doctor Quinn 
conclusion i love it 
it be a long time since I be so entertain by a movie 
I struggle to find anything bad to say about it 
Mark my word this be one of those cult film like Evil Dead 2 or Phantasm that people will still be discover and fall in love with 20 30 40 year down the line 
it be pretty surprising that this wonderful film be make in 1949 as Hollywood generally have its collective head in the sand concern black and white issue at that time 
the film deserve strong kudos for take this stand for have exceptional act from its mostly lesser known cast and for the super intelligent script that do not insult the audience or take the easy way out when it come to white racism 
plus with the movie 's rather modest budget and fast run time it do a amazing job 
Juano Hernandez a exceptional actor who play support role in many film of the era be a proud black man who be accuse of murder a white man in the South 
Trumbull on I love lucy 
see it with you kid if you have a chance it will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relation have come in the last 50 year 
see both film if you can 
it be that year however that remind we that Huston be still at the top of he game as evince by he faithful adaptation of James Joyce 's acclaimed novella the dead 
feeling thought Gabriel 's discomfort during the dance all these intangible leap to life and come within the viewer 's grasp in Huston 's portrayal 
this movie be possibly one of the most creative work of horror ever 
it have everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplot native american brain eating if you be look for the be all end all of brainsuck movie look no further 
with great sound effect and impressive special effect I can not recommend this movie enough 
call I a nut but I think this be one of the best movie ever 
great character actor Telly Savalas and Peter Boyle 
I will not spoil it but the end in pretty amazing 
the best scene in the movie be at the end but I will not spoil it 
if there be ever a indication of a writer and a director 's ability to meld two highly volatile temperament into a seamless union of creativity then this be it 
the result be a powerhouse achievement make more timely now perhaps because of we culture 's disturbing fascination with celebrity and it be distorted interpretation of fame 
but Kevin Spacey be a excellent verbal tsunami as Buddy Ackerman and totally believable because he be a great actor 
the scripting of the subtle comedy be unmatched by any movie in recent year 
the character be interesting even if a bit predictable 
highly recommend for all age although they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 
great movie 
Linda Cardellini be the only thing good in this film 
she be poise and amazing 
the fact be this film be a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chase they dream 
the best part about nurse Betty be it be unpredictability 
Director Neil LaBute use brutal violence to seperate dream from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what be go to happen next 
there be however some pretty good act at least for this type of film 
I see this short film on HBO the other day and absolutely love it 
I do not realize how wonderful the short really be until the last two scene 
excellent short film 
hopefully the director James Cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win we over with a whole new film 
the whole film be shoot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 
funny clever hip just like Pray 's previous film hype 
it be a long time that i do not see a so charismatic actor on screen 
Paolo Sorrentino have write a wonderful story about loneliness and Tony have build one of the most unforgettable character see in movie in recent year 
I rate this movie 9 10 
the interplay between Martin and Emilio contain the same wonderful chemistry we see in Wall Street with Martin and Charlie 
Kathy Bates be wonderful in she character subtle desperation and escapism a variation on she character in at Play in the Fields of the lord 
for reader who have already see one of Miyazaki 's film he be still in top form and make another worthwhile experience 
it never condescend all the character have good genuine heart and believable problem 
the two main character may be two of the most believable child I ever see put on screen 
they be so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 
this movie be great especially if you enjoy visual art 
the scenery that the two daughter paint and photograph be beautiful 
the story be also both funny and poignant at time 
people who like european film and art movie will like this movie 
this be truly a art movie it actually have a lot of art in it 
go rent it 
it be the one movie that never cease to interest I simply because it keep I alert as I try to attempt to decipher it be meaning 
brilliance indeed 
but if you like movie like the Matrix and better yet they sequel I think you will appreciate the thought provoke mindblowing experience this film will give you 
think of the film be like a dream 
simply beautiful 
both Rickman and Stowe play they role to the hilt in this tale of a children ' book writer who maybe have write a subversive tract 
it be a gloriously fun fast pace and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 
it present a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the up and downs of the character life 
but it pick up speed and get right to the point 
it show exactly how the government and the scientist argue for humanity and the reason of the gadget 
I enjoy it 
I have recommend it to friend 
I be particularly please with the act ability of Dwight Schultz 
both actor truly understand and become they particular character deliver a convincing sincere performance 
they on screen chemistry critical to the entire film be genuine 
the film 's dialogue be natural real to life 
the writer Gorman Bechard undoubtedly do he homework because all reference be industry and character age appropriate 
the incredible soundtrack truly capture the essence of the film 
each track command sentiment actually contribute to the scene and character

tie to charger for conversation last more than 45 minute major problem
if you have several dozen or several hundred contact then imagine the fun of send each of they one by one
needless to say I waste my money
what a waste of money and time
if the two be seperate by a mere 5 ft I start to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset
the design be very odd as the ear clip be not very comfortable at all
I advise everyone do NOT be FOOLED
it click into place in a way that make you wonder how long that mechanism would last
I go on Motorola's website and follow all direction but could not get it to pair again
the commercial be the most misleading
I buy it for my mother and she have a problem with the battery
I do not think that the instruction provide be helpful to I
people couldnt hear I talk and I have to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone
do not hold charge
this be a simple little phone to use but the breakage be unacceptible
it be unusable in a move car at freeway speed
I have two more year leave in this contract and I hate this phone
you need at least 3 min to get to you phone book from the time you first turn on the phone Battery life be short
Poor talk Time Performance
worthless product
I be not impress by this product
I only hear garbage for audio
who in they right mind be gon na buy this battery
after argue with VERIZON REGARDING the drop CALLS WE return the phone after two day
disappoint with battery
not loud enough and do not turn on like it should
very disappointed
the button for on and off be bad
essentially you can forget Microsoft's tech support
buy a different phone but not this
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly
the one big drawback of the mp3 player be that the button on the phone's front cover that let you pause and skip song lock out after a few seconds
a week later after I activate it it suddenly die
Mic do not work
even in my BMW 3 series which be fairly quiet I have trouble hear what the other person be say
do not buy for d807 wrongly advertise for d807
I purchase this and within 2 day it be no longer work
the battery run down quickly
this item work great but it break after 6 month of use
the construction of the headset be poor
for a product that cost as much as this one do I expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing do
the ear bud only play music in one ear
Dont waste you money
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it
I find this product to be waaay too big
I be very disappoint with my decision
Buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet
I receive my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there be not a match between the phone and the charger
that be a huge design flaw unless I be not use it correctly which I do not think be the case
the camera although rate at a impressive 13 megapixel render image that fall well below expectation of such a relatively high resolution
I purcash this for the car charger and it do not work
i get this phone around the end of may and i be completely unhappy with it
bad quality
basically the service be very bad
it do not work in my cell phone plug i be very up set with the charger
the BT headset be such a disapoinment
Buyer be very careful
the majority of the Logitech earbud headset fail
in my house I be get drop coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement
what a waste
during several different 2 minute call I experience 5 drop and it be in a area that have 5 bar
I be not happy with this item
very disappointed
the phone take forever to charge like 2 to 5 hour literally
what a waste of time
its reception be very very poor
item state as include from the description be not include
after 3 month screen just go black all of a sudden
I be hope for more
Audio Quality be poor very poor
I have buy 5 wire headphone that sound better than these
all I can do be whine on the internet so here it go the more I use the thing the less I like it
this be essentially a communication tool that do not communicate
I still maintain that monkey should not make headphone we just obviously do not share enough dna to copy the design over to human
do not work at all I bougth it for my l7c and its not work
do not last long
one thing I hate be the mode set button at the side
thank you for waste my money
how can that be the audio quality be poor
I put the latest os on it v1 15g and it now like to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while
it only recognize the phone as its storage device
if you like a loud buzz to override all you conversation then this phone be for you
do not buy this product
I have have this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fit on the ear
I have this phone and it be a thorn in my side I really abhor it
I recently have problem where I could not stay connect for more than 10 minute before be disconnect
design flaw
Waste of 13 buck
but when I check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turn off a few seconds into the first message and then I be lose
the replacement die in a few week
I have have problem wit hit drop signal and more
not impressed
bad choice
the pleather case do not fit
useless phone simply deaf
it make very strange tick noise before it end the call
battery last only a few hour
we be send it back
I do not bother contact the company for few dollar product but I learn the lesson that I should not have buy this form online anyway
if you hate earbug avoid this phone by all means
I also do not like the on button it feel like it would crack with use
WORST PHONE EVER
freeze frequently4
it be kind of embarrassing to use because of how it look and mostly it be embarrassing how child like the company be
all in all I would expect a better consumer experience from Motorola
there be a horrible tick sound in the background on all my call that I have never experience before
I be a bit disappointed
I have have this phone for over a year now and I will tell you its not that great
the battery be completely useless to I
what a big waste of time
do not waste you on this one
do not make the same mistake as I
big disappointment with calendar sync
the phone be unusable and be not new
worst customer Service ever
no additional ear gel provide and no instruction whatsoever
it defeat the purpose of a bluetooth headset
internet be excrutiatingly slow
this product have a strong rubber petroleum smell that be unbearable after a while and cause I to return it
poor quality and service
the cable look so thin and flimsy it be scary
Absolutel junk
that one do not work either
return 8 hour later
do not waste you money
not only will it drain you player but may also potentially fry it
unreliable I be give up
avoid this one if you can
I waste my little money with this earpiece
First of all it do not wear well
I would not recommend buy this product
piece of junk
poorly contstruct hinge
do not buy it
DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PHONE
customer service be terrible
battery life still not long enough in Motorola Razor v3i
send it back
as many people complain I find this headset's microphone be very weak
my 5 year old Nokia 2160 from Tracfone hold the charge a lot better than this
they do not care about the consumer one bit
the instruction manual be lack
the battery be unreliable as well as the service use antena
it be uncomfortable and the sound quality be quite poor compare with the phone Razr or with my previous wire headset that plug into a lg
I want my money back
I order this product first and be unhappy with it immediately
the ngage be still lack in earbud
I have 2 3 bar on my cell phone when I be home but you can not not hear anything
however the riingtone be not the best and neither be the game
the plug do not work very well
AMAZON suck
Rip off over charge shipping
1 long lasting battery you do not have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phone 2
obviously there be a problem with the adhesive
very disappointing
it be a inexpensive piece but I would still have expect better quality
it be practically useless and do not add any kind of boost to my reception after I buy it
be not happy
a piece of JUNK that break after be on MY PHONE for 2 day
worst customer service
reception be terrible and full of static
I be sit in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lose signal
be jerk on the phone
they network coverage in Los Angeles be horrible
excellent starter wireless headset
the loudspeaker option be great the bumper with the light be very appealing
the only thing that I think could improve be the sound leak out from the headset
first off the reception suck I have never have more than 2 bar ever
the phone get extremely hot
also if you phone be drop this case be not go to save it specially when drop face down
bad fit way too big
Waste of money
I will be drivng along and my headset start ring for no reason
the worst phone I have ever have only have it for a few month
not a good item it work for a while then start have problem in my auto reverse tape player
this be so embarassing and also my ear hurt if I try to push the ear plug into my ear
this be a very average phone with bad battery life that operate on a weak network
so yo technology suck
same problem as other have mention
the worst piece of crap ever along with the Verizon customer service
Poor sound quality
the picture resolution be far below what other comparably price phone be offer today
use all earpiece leave or right this thing will not stay on my ear
still wait I be sure this item would work well if I ever recieve it
what a disappointment
do not waste you money and time
it be so stupid to have to keep buy new charger car charger cradle headphone and car kit every time a new phone come out
I come over from Verizon because cingulair have nicer cell phone the first thing I notice be the really bad service
I will be look for a new earpiece
we receive a WHITE color battery that go dead after a couple hour the original use to last a week but still last longer than the replacement
after a year the battery go completely dead on my headset
this be the first phone I have have that have be so cheaply make
att be not clear sound be very distorted and you have to yell when you talk
the plastic break really easy on this clip
do not make the same mistake I do
oh and I forget to also mention the weird color effect it have on you phone
also the area where my unit break I be not too fond of the magnetic strap
another note about this phone's appearance be that it really look rather bland especially in the all black model
low Quality
warning Stay away
I wish I could return the unit and get back my money
I use to talk on it for 1 1 1 2 hour and the battery would be literally drain and die
if you do not find it too bad as again the unit come with one earpad only I would not recommend this to anyone
very displeased
I might have get a defect but I would not risk buy it again because of the build quality alone
they make this case too small and be very difficult to install
do not fit
there be really nothing bad I can say about this headset
I even fully charge it before I go to bed and turn off blue tooth and wi fi and notice that it only have 20 leave in the morning
I have also have problem with the phone read the memory card in which I always turn it on and then off again
not good when wear a hat or sunglass
horrible phone
battery be junk
cant get the software to work with my computer
disappoint
poor voice clarity
no buyer remorse on this one
very disappoint in AccessoryOne
I find this inexcusable and so will probably be return this phone and perhaps change carrier
the update procedure be difficult and cumbersome
disappointment I hate anything that go in my ear
uncomfortable in the ear do not use
the volume switch rocket out of the unit to a destination unknown
I would like to return it
Verizon's bill however be difficult to understand even though they pricing plan be simple
a disappointment
its not user friendly
unfortunately the ability to actually know you be receive a call be a rather important feature and this phone be pitiful
then I exchange for the same phone even that have the same problem
this result in the phone be either stick at max volume or mute
Pretty piece of junk
plug be the wrong size
save you money I have have this item for 11 month now
bad purchase
defective crap
I would have give no star if I be able
the sound quality for the device be unacceptable unless you be in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing
I would not recommend this item to anyone
the holster that arrive do not match the photo in the ad
as a earlier review note plug in this charger and nothing happen
you never know if you push it hard enough or the right number of time for the function you want or not
I be not impress with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone
my only complaint be the standard sound volume be a little low even when turn up to 5 of 5
REALLY UGLY
horrible have to switch 3 time
no real improvement
they refuse to refund or replace
unfortunately it be easy to accidentally activate they with the gentle touch button if you accidentally touch the phone to you face while listen
so I basically throw my money out the window for nothing
all it take be one drop from about 6 inch above the kitchen counter and it be crack I be not impressed and I be not laugh
none of the new one have ever quite work properly
I have miss numerous call because of this reason
perhaps my phone be defective but people can not hear I when I use this
do not buy this product
suck most of the stuff do not work with my phone
worst software ever use if I could give this zero star I would
try to make a call on these be a exercise in frustration
the case be a flimsy piece of plastic and have no front or side protection whatsoever
I give wirefly 1 star I will contact Cingular at t and inform they of this practice
it be aggravate
none of it work just do not buy it
Muddy low quality sound and the case around the wire's insert be poorly super glue and slide off
please dont waste you money
yet Plantronincs continue to use the same flawed charger design
disapoint result
cumbersome design
it be a piece of crap
my experience be terrible this be my fourth bluetooth headset and while it be much more comfortable than my last Jabra which I hate
worst ever
I can barely ever hear on it and be constantly say what
the battery life be highly unacceptable
that company be a joke
due to this happen on every call I be force to stop use this headset
Verizon tech support walk my through a few procedure none of which work and I end up have to do a hard re set wipe out all my datum
Voice Quality Signal strength drop call
it feel poorly construct the menu be difficult to navigate and the button be so recess that it be difficult to push they
also difficult to put on I would recommend avoid this product
I only use it two day and it be not always easy to hear with
I get the car charger and not even after a week the charger be break I go to plug it in and it start smoking
Sprint terrible customer service
what possese I to get this junk I have no idea
piece of trash
the real killer be the volume and of course it break
Poor Construction
this be infuriate
Sprint charge for this service
it be cheap and it feel and look just as cheap
it do not work in Europe or Asia
the worst phone from samsung crap this crappy Samsung e715 be the worst i have ever seeen
the charger work for about a week and then completely stop charge my phone
Poor product
however I need some better instruction
you need two hand to operate the screen this software interface be decade old and can not compete with new software design
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine Palm replacementr pen which come in a three pack
DO NOT BUY DO NOT BUYIT suck
plus I seriously do not believe it be worth its steep price point
very dissapointing Performance
do not make the same mistake that I do and please do not buy this phone
this phone might well be the worst I have ever have in any brand
case be more or less a extra that I originally put on but later discard because it scratch my ear
do not bother go to the store
however BT headset be currently not good for real time game like first person shooter since the audio delay mess I up
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer
perform awful muffle tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for
I contact the company and they tell I that although the unit be still under warranty if I could not produce my receipt I be out of luck
linksy should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something
when I place my treo into the case not only be it not snug but there be a lot of extra room on the side
battery be terrible
the earpiece on this be too large or too heavy it keep fall out of my ear
Utter crap sound quality be terrible
the charger arrive within the promise timeframe but it do not work
finally after three or four time the spring of the latch break and I could not use it any longer on the visor
talk about useless customer service
it feel too light and tinny
this do not fit the Palm Tungsten e2 and it break the first time I try to plug it in
I could not recommend these more
look good in the picture but this case be a huge disappointment
its extremely slow and take forever to do anything with it
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sin of industrial design
the first thing that happen be that the tracking be off
then I have to continue pair it periodically since it somehow keep drop
ca not upload ringtone from a third party
Bluetooth do not work phone lock up screen just flash up and now it just make call randomly while in my pocket lock
truly awful
and none of the tone be acceptable
camera color balance be AWFUL
this product be clearly not ready for prime time I do not care how cool it look if you can not tell a call be come in it be worthless
chinese forgery abound
the instruction do not explain that a microphone jack could be use
i would advise to not purchase this item it never work very well
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service
the nokia CA 42 usb cable do not work with my phone
the biggest complaint I have be the battery drain superfast
the design might be ergonomic in theory but I could not stand have these in my ear
do NOT buy if you want to use the holster
it do not make you look cool
also the phone do not seem to accept anything except CBR mp3 preferably rip by Windows Media Player
so just beware
so anyone near you will hear part of you conversation
I buy this phone as a replacement for my StarTac and have regret it since
ca not store anything but phone number to SIM
it last less than 3o minute if I actually try to use the phone my wife have the same phone with the same problem
Poor quality
not worth it
the phone crash completely and now I have to get it replace
unfortunately it will not recharge my iPhone 4 despite connect it from multiple power source iMac external battery wall outlet etc
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bell whistle be mediocre
think it over when you plan to own this one this sure be the last moto phone for I
after receive and use the product for just 2 day it break
none of the three size they send with the headset would stay in my ear
we have try 2 unit and they both fail within 2 month pro
it dit not work most of the time with my Nokia 5320
bought mainly for the charger which break soon after purchase
if you like a loud buzz to override all you conversation then this phone be for you
stay away from this store be careful
do not fit
disappointing
the camera on the phone may be use as a dustpan when indoors I would rather be use a disposable then this

the screen do get smudge easily because it touch you ear and face
what a piece of junk I lose more call on this phone
Item do not Match Picture
the only thing that disappoint I be the infra red port irda
you can not answer call with the unit never work once
a very very very slow move aimless movie about a distressed drift young man
not sure who be more lose the flat character or the audience nearly half of whom walk out
attempt artiness with black white and clever camera angle the movie disappointed become even more ridiculous as the acting be poor and the plot and line almost non existent
very little music or anything to speak of
the rest of the movie lack art charm meaning if it be about emptiness it work I guess because it be empty
waste two hour
a bit predictable
it have some average act from the main person and it be a low budget as you clearly can see
this short film certainly pull no punch
Graphics be far from the best part of the game
today the graphic be crap
this be a flick doom from its conception
the very idea of it be lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg 13 film and make a complete non sequel while change its tone to a pg rate family movie
I be not the least bit interested
not only do it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also manage to give away the entire movie and I be not exaggerate every moment every plot point every joke be tell in the trailer
but it be just not funny
but even the talented Carrell can not save this
he co star do not fare much better with people like Morgan Freeman Jonah Hill and Ed Helms just waste
the story itself be just predictable and lazy
the only real effect work be the presence of all the animal and the integration of those into the scene be some of the worst and most obvious blue green screen work I have ever see
but whatever it be that cost they so much it do not translate to quality that be for sure
on the negative it be insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hour of life waste in front of the screen
long whiny and pointless
but I recommend wait for they future effort let this one go
I be very disappointed in the movie
one character be totally annoying with a voice that give I the feeling of fingernail on a chalkboard
there be a totally unnecessary train roller coaster scene
there be absolutely no warmth or charm to these scene or character
this movie totally grate on my nerve
the performance be not improve by improvisation because the actor now have twice as much to worry about not only whether they be deliver the line well but whether the line itself be any good
and quite honestly often its not very good
often the dialogue do not really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings
it crackle with a unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i find it hard to follow and concentrate on it meander so badly
I would not say they be worth 2 hour of you time though
I be glad this pretentious piece of s do not do as plan by the Dodge stratus Big Shots it be gon na help movie maker who be not in the very restrained movie business of Qu bec
the problem be the script
it be horrendous
there be nothing believable about it at all
the only suspense I be feeling be the frustration at just how retard the girl be
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it be kind of embarrassing to watch Lane and Gere in this film because it be bad
the acting be bad the dialog be extremely shallow and insincere
it be too predictable even for a chick flick
too politically correct
very disappointing
I love Lane but I have never see she in a movie this lousy
a hour and a half I wish I could bring back
the movie be so boring that I sometimes find myself occupy peak in the paper instead of watch never happen during a Columbo movie before
and sometimes it be so embarrassing that I have to look away
the directing seem too pretentious
the scene with the oh so mature neighbour girl be a misplace
and generally the line and plot be weaker than the average episode
then scene where they debate whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely be accuse for the murder be pure horror really stupid
my only problem be I think the actor play the villain be a low rent Michael Ironside
however this do not make up for the fact that overall this be a tremendously boring movie
there be no chemistry between Ben Affleck and Sandra Bullock in this film and I could not understand why he would consider even leave he wife to be for this chick that he supposedly be knock out by
there be several moment in the movie that just do not need to be there and be excruciatingly slow move
this be a poor remake of my best Friends wedding
all in all a great disappointment
I can not believe that the actor agree to do this film
I could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of lose I Q
I guess that nobody at the network that air this dribble watch it before put it on
IMDB rating only go as low 1 for awful it be time to get some negative number in there for case such as these
I see Mirrormask last night and it be a unsatisfactory experience
unfortunately inexperience of direction mean that scene after scene pass with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict
these be the central theme of the film and they be handle ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination
all the pretty picture in the world can not make up for a piece of work that be flaw at the core
it be a hour and half waste of time follow a bunch of very pretty high schooler whine and cry about life
you can not relate with they hell you barely can understand they
this movie be a pure disaster the story be stupid and the editing be the worst I have see it confuse you incredibly
the fish be badly make and some of its underwater shot be repeat a thousand time in the film
a truly truly bad film
the acting be terrible and the writing be worse
the only possible way this movie could be redeem would be as mst3k fodder
I pay too much
it be so boring
no plot whatsoever
again no plot at all
horrible
worst hour and a half of my life oh my gosh
I hate movie like that
yeah the movie pretty much suck
there be no plot or storyline
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriend boyfriend to keep you occupy through out
awful
I do not think I have ever go to a movie and dislike it as much
nobody identify with these character because they be all cardboard cutout and stereotype or predictably reverse stereotype
this be a bad film with bad writing and good actor a ugly cartoon craft by Paul Haggis for people who can not handle anything but the bold stroke in storytelling a picture paint with crayon
Crash be a depressing little nothing that provoke emotion but teach you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice be bad thing
you brain will attempt to shut down as part of a primal impulse of self preservation
I be leave shatter from the experience of watch this ` film ' and I take a good two hour to fully recover
this movie now join revenge of the Boogeyman and Zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror film
I mean this in a terrible way
this film have no redeeming feature
everything be appalling
artless camera work endlessly present we with the ugliest setting imaginable i e
the story be beyond stupid
the script be be there a script
the kid be annoy
the lead man be charisma free
utterly without merit on any level this be akin to torture
I will even say it again this be torture
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity
not a pleasant voyage of self discovery
highly unrecommended
if this premise sound stupid that be because it be
yes it be that bad
nothing at all to recommend
this movie suffer because of the write it need more suspense
there be too many close up
but other than that the movie seem to drag and the hero do not really work for they freedom
but this movie be definitely a below average rent
this movie be bad
so bad
the film be way too long
this be definitely one of the bad one
I really do not see how anyone could enjoy this movie
I do not think I have ever see a movie half as boring as this self indulgent piece of junk
it probably would have be better if the director have not spend most of the movie showcase he own art work which really be not that noteworthy
another thing I do not really like be when a character get punch in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after
ironically I mostly find he film a total waste of time to watch
it be this pandering to the audience that sabotage most of he film
hence the whole story lack a certain energy
the plot simply rumble on like a machine desperately depend on the addition of new scene
there be the usual hitchcock logic flaw
Mishima be extremely uninteresting
this be a chilly unremarkable movie about a author living work in a chilly abstruse culture
the flat reenactment do not hold you attention because they be emotionally adrift and stagy
and the rest of it just sit there be awful with soldier sing song about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitt about purity the admiration of sword etc
he can bear you to piece and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else
Schrader have make a resume full of lousy amateurish film
however I recently watch the whole thing again on dvd and I be completely strike by how extremely stupid the storyline be how it contain hole inconsistency and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing be
I mean in a realistic world she would never have get into that ballet repertory the whole thing be quite pathetic
the character development also lack in depth
woa talk about awful
do not waste you time
it be just too horrible
the worst sappiest dialogue I could go on and on
but what really make it unwatchable be the direction
the poor actor
you can not even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic line to speak but the director give they no action
if you check the director's filmography on this site you will see why this film do not have a chance
regrettably the film fail
the movie lack visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underline the narrative
no actress have be worse use that June Allison in this movie
unfortunately this be a bad movie that be just plain bad
bad script bad direction and horrible act make this one plain bad
the dialogue suck
the cinematography if it can be call that suck
the soundtrack suck
the act suck
the concert sequence just suck
overall this movie be cheap trash
but this movie be not funny consider the ridiculousness of it
I come out of it feel angry
I be not sure what he be try to do with this film
if it be to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memory than I guess he succeed
it be force like everything in this movie
again lame
here's where the movie really pi ed I off
when I see it in the theater I think I be go to be sick
Summary The witticism be not witty
the plot well I say I would let that one go
the acting be bad
really bad
even Billy Bob could not rise above the script which be worse
camerawork again bad
Rating 1 out of 10
I literally vomit while watch this film
I be translate movie for a living and this be the first movie in my 5 year work experience that I find offensive to my intelligence
but when someone strive for greatness and poetry but deliver a muddle and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scene pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately define as pretentious crap
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful I can only say it be you intelligence and you imagination you obviously use to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt it be in we human nature to try and make sense of thing
one more thing I can tolerate political incorrectness very well I be all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character be just too much
which have more depth and character than the man underneath it
the Malta setting be as dry and as barren as the dialogue
this movie be terrible
the hockey scene be terrible defenseman play like they be 5 year old goalie diving at shot that be 10 foot wide of the net etc
for those that have not see it do not waste you time
to call this movie a drama be ridiculous
start watch this but do not believe in any of the character
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just do not work for I at all
it be a very superficial movie and it give I the feeling that I be watch play rather than a film
by the time the pyromaniac waylay the assistant I be bore and do not care what happen next and so I switch off
glad I do not pay to see it
do not laugh or even smile once
but it be not anything at all just one big yawn
but storm trooper be not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movie
it be just lame
the guy who say he be have better dialogue with he potted plant have it right
everything about this movie be stupid
even if you love bad movie do not watch this movie
it be shameful
the new character be not all that memorable and I find myself forget who be who
I feel as though she go to Ireland do absolutely nothing whatsoever
it do not make I scared horrify or make I sympathetic towards the character it be simply annoying
the jerky camera movement be also annoying
the plot be the same as pretty much every other cheap horror
there be a few pathetic attempt to give the character some depth but it do not really work into the rest of the plot
I guess it be suppose to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it be just stupid
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf
this totally unfunny movie be so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minute of utter torture I probably look at my watch about 70000 time
Lucy Bell be so much higher than this crap and for she to sink this low be quite depressing
all this movie do be make you sick watch all these slacker make excuse for they stupid action for 90 minute
God and I can never get that 90 minute back
almost all of the song in Cover Girl be old fashion and not very tuneful
the most annoying thing about ` Cover Girl ' be the way in which Rita Hayworth be put up on a pedestal
unfortunately ` Cover Girl ' be a example of how Hollywood use to exploit woman for financial gain
I could not take they seriously
I be a fan of he this movie suck really bad
even worse than Ticker
that movie be bad
only like 3 or 4 building use a couple of location maybe poor hummh
it just blow
now we be choose to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda
this show be make for Americans it be too stupid and full with hatred and clich s to be admit elsewhere
almost everyone involve must be return to school acting be utterly predictable and bad script be pile of garbage all round
I wish I could enter negative value admin
the set be so bad they would not look out of place on a Thunderbirds episode
the use of slow motion needlessly repeat itself throughout the movie but be well back up by bad act and bad be a kind word here no continuity scene that be throw in for no reason whatsoever vehicle that look like they be make from a Corn Flakes box and a directorial style that border on stupidity
oh yeah and the storyline be pathetic too
I hate write bad review about film especially those in which I really like the star but this film be so bad I do not believe for one second that anyone could have be proud of it
I be not a filmmaker nor be I a director but I would hide my head in the sand if I would spend whatever amount of money and time on this movie
in short this be a monumental waste of time and energy and I would not recommend anyone to ever see this film
it come free with a dvd player I buy but I still turn the thing off halfway through because I be embarrass for Howell
1 10 and only because there be no setting for 0 10
but the act even that of such professional as Drago and Debbie Rochon be terrible the direct worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimp like and the camera work barely tolerable
yes I be simplify thing here for the sake of brevity for this really be at the core of the problem with this film it have too much go on without any real fulfil explanation
but the convoluted plot just do not convince I and much of the film be watch with a weird question glance
I let my girlfriend talk I into see this bad idea we both hate it
Bela Lugosi be totally extraneous intone odd line
the acting be decidely wooden though no worse than a period Universal B movie
wow what a bad film
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible
the plot do not hang together at all and the acting be absolutely appalling
I be not expect Oscar material but this
you would have to have the IQ of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one come
this film and I use that word loosely be a insult to the movie go public
if only someone involve with it know how to string together narrative
this get a 1 out of 10 simply because there be nothing lower
this be one I do not have but I watch it recently on Fox Movie Channel and be very disappointed
I know he be a contract player with little control over he script but the acting be as bad as the script
Victor McLaglen be even bad and Brian DonLevy be almost unrecognizable
consider the relation off screen between Taylor and Stanwyck it be surprising how little chemistry there be on screen between the two of they
but the premise of the film be so ridiculous that the President of the U S
the death row scene be entirely unmoving
the only thing worse than Taylor's acting be Stanwyck's singing
whatever the producer be go for he miss entirely
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lot of underbite style stoic emoting think Chow Yun Fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clich s throw into a abandon factory ready for a few poorly execute fly judo roll a la John Woo
even the squib look awful
at no point in the proceedings do it look remotely like America
the plot such as it be be so derivative and predictable that the end be like a mercy killing
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who get shot top off a real waste of space and time
I be very uneasy with how bad this movie be but not scare at all
the dialogue be compose of thing that make little sense
about 30 minute of footage be waste to show mediocre elderly actor awkwardly babble overwrought pseudo satanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen Goth blush almost always in Olde English and sometimes in Latin that may or may not be make up word
the directing be sloppy at best
hackneyed write certainly but make even worse by the bad directing
of course the acting be blah
the act by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underact
and finally after all that we get to a end that would have be great have it be handle by competent people and not Jerry Falwell
I particularly remember my sens be assault by strident cord of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning
it be just the sort of pap that be screen in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not have job
about ten minute into this film I start have second thought
about half way through this film I start to dislike it
by the time the film end I not only dislike it I despise it
what this film lack be a convincing script
the script look as if only a rough draft be write and shooting begin before a finish script be complete
thing happen character personality change plot twist occur for no real reason other than that script call for it
this be probably the most irritating show I have ever see in my entire life
it be indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show I have ever see
everything about it be just bad
I could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season
the script be bad very bad it contain both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rate r or nc 17 movie
the casting be also horrible cause all you see be a really really bad actor period
final word this show be a real torture
it be zillion time away from reality
watch wash machine twirl around would not hurt you eye as much as this show
Rating 0 10 Grade z note the show be so bad that even mother of the cast Pull she Daughter out of the show
20th Century Fox's road HOUSE 1948 be not only quite a silly noir but be a implausible unmitigated bear of a movie
full of unconvincing cardboard character it be blandly write by Edward Chodorov who also produce and be surprisingly direct by Jean Negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more
from here on the Widmark character turn unintentionally comical
he lose he marble so early in the proceedings be totally implausible and unconvincing
and if that be not enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture be also mar with a constant use of studio set and indoor exterior
whatever prompt such a documentary be beyond I
very serious spoiler this movie be a huge disappointment
there be so many problem i dont know where to start
but the movie make a lot of serious mistake
first of all there be enough racial stereotype and racial joke to offend everyone
the movie be litter with overt racial slur towards the black cast member and in return the whites be depict as moron and boob
put the race card aside let look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifa's character
there be no real plot
i wouldnt see this movie again for free
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a Luv's diaper commercial be completely unconvincing
I be terribly disappoint that this film would receive so many award and accolade especially when there be far more deserving work of film out there
I do not think there be any redeeming quality in this remake
this may be the only bad film he ever make
so bad well it be just bad
this movie be a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way
it be a shame to see good actor like Thomerson and James make a living in a mess
I think it be bad
both film be terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it be watchable
let's start with all the problem the acting especially from the lead professor be very very bad
the script be a big flawed mess
the best example of how dumb the writing be when it be establish that you can turn the zombie student back into human by remove a necklace contain a piece of the meteorite
Director Paul Matthews who also write direct the weak 1995 monster movie Grim clearly do not know how to pace he film
the movie be terribly boring in place
the lighting be awful
the film look cheap and bland
one of the most disappointing aspect be the lack of notable gore
this convention never work well in the past and certainly do not work here
the visual effect be AWFUL
the explosion of the gas tank at the end be just as awful
to sum the film up breeder be a terrible cheaply make horror movie that should be avoid like the ebola virus
not recommend
he be almost unbearable to watch on screen he have little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing
aside from it be terrible lead this film have load of other debit
I understand that it be suppose to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that do not mean that it have to completely insult we intelligence and have write so incredibly hackneyed that it border on offensive
Lewis Black's considerable talent be waste here too as he be at he most incendiary when he be unrestrained which the pg 13 rating certainly will not allow
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spend this remake have little else to offer
the budget be evidently very limited
this be reflect not only in the cast but also in the below par script which borrow much from the earlier classic
however here there be no decent act action or location work to balance thing up
filmie be less expansive
it fail to convey the broad sweep of landscape that be a great part of the original
generally it just lack imagination
not recommend
be it possible for a movie to get any worse than this
there be no plot here to keep you go in the first place
even when the woman finally show up there be no sign of improvement the most expect thing happen and by the time the film be over you might be far asleep
beware this be not a trashy cult movie this be trash period
I can not believe there be even a sequel to this
which be precisely why I be give it such a bad review
every element of this story be so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it be painful to sit through
she line seem to have be write by a fifteen year old though they be try oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk
there be simply no excuse for something this poorly do
I see this movie and I think this be a stupid movie
what be even more stupid be that who have think a idea that there should be a volcano in Los Angeles
to be honest with you this be unbelievable nonsense and very foolish
in conclusion I will not bother with this movie because a volcano in Los Angeles be nothing but nonsense
the story line be just awful
it be just painful
and the accent be absolutely abysmal
there be also enough hypocrisy in this film to make I vomit
do not waste you time watch this rubbish non research film
omit watch this
my rating just 3 out of 10
the basic premise be waste since it be sideline by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew
regardless the film fail on most level
avoid at all cost
I know that Jim O'Connor be very energetic and that nobody could be as much as he but George be well dull
he really do not seem to want to be host he voice over be monotonous
this movie be so mind bendingly awful it could not have even be create
the film lack any real scare or tension some of the medical terminology use throughout be a bit iffy to say the least I say that as a insulin dependant diabetic myself
the least say about the act the better
even allow for poor production value for the time 1971 and the format some kind of mini series this be baaaaaad
unless you be just out to visually collect all extant film of Austen's work you can skip this one
it be not good
speak of the music it be unbearably predictably and kitchy
then the film just drop the ball
there be many continuity error one other user comment on different car in the garage Joe's glass the one that get to I the most be the fact Joe's facial hair configuration seem to change from scene to scene
I can not see how this movie can be a inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection
it be so bad it be actually worth see just for that reason
well just if you keep think how bad it be
it be a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage
it be a case of ` so bad it be laughable '
very bad performance play Angela Bennett a computer expert who be at home all the time
it be a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scene
how awful she be
but she be still a bad actress repeat she robotic face move in each of she picture
the result well be a shame
delete this film from you mind
one of the worst show of all time
the show would begin with smart ass ed comment to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for
the fat computer geek be unbelievable the bible thumper the bad ass girl who be these actor
never hear of any of they except Cole who be totally unbelievable in the part
every time he open he mouth you expect to hear you see kid pull the plug be a mercy killing for this horrible show
the story be as unbelievable as the actor
lame would be the best way to describe it
im big fan of RPG game too but this movie its a disgrace to any self respect rpger there be
the line the cut the audio everything be wrong
you can find better movie at youtube
top line do not waste you time and money on this one its as bad as it come
a Lassie movie which should have be put to sleep forever
that be how I would describe this painfully dreary time waster of a film
so mediocre in every aspect that it just become a dull uninteresting mess this be one of the most forgettable movie I have see
it be a empty hollow shell of a movie
seriously it be not worth waste you or you kid's time on
avoid avoid avoid
it will drive you bark mad
nothing new there
that be do in the second movie
the movie have almost no action scene in it and very little comedy
the plot have more hole than a pair of fishnet stocking and the direction and editing be astonishingly ham fist
what on earth be Irons do in this film
the football scene at the end be perplexing
this scene be very strong and unpleasant
and it be bore
I be so tired of clich s that be just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast
why be this film make
the film have a ultra cheap look to it
the result be a film that just do not look right
none of they be engage or exciting
the plot be nonsense that do not interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it
the Foreigner be not worth one second of you time
how this piece of trash be ever release be beyond I the act the story the character the supposedly special effect etc it be all wrong
avoid at all cost
Star Trek V The final Frontier be the worst in the series
the act from all involve and that include those like Shatner and Nimoy be bad and wash out and make they seem as old as they look in real life the special effect be tacky like when Spock have to rescue Kirk on a jet pack when he fall down from a mountain
the attempt at humor be pitiful and story be so awful it dose not bear think about which basically involve a Vulcan steal the enterprise to find god seriously I just do not care about any of this film and oh not to mention Uhura do a belly dance to distract male guard
the worst one of the series
very disappointed and wonder how it could be in the Oscar shortlist
it be very slow
lot of hole in the plot there be nothing about how he become the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 year between he childhood and mature age
do not waste you time
end of day be one of the worst big budget action movie I have ever see
he surely do not know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of Air Force one who be only oblige to write the script just for a big sum of money
this be one of the worst film i have ever see
I be still try to get over how bad it be
lot of hole in the script
now imagine that every single one of those decision be make wrong
the dialogue be atrocious
the acting be beyond abysmal
everything stink
worse there be a incredibly weak sub plot throw in that follow a little band of latter day mansonite as they go after a reporter who be work on a story on the anniversary of the killing
it be dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time
in short do not bother with this movie
also the story and act be weak
at around 4 pm I buy it at around 8pm I start to watch at around 8 15pm I fast forward the remain film to see if there be anything left watchable for a human be with a brain but there be not
either way it suck
the script be horrendously stupid
the story start too fast with absolutely no suspense or build up in the slightest
everything Captain Howdy say be either laughable or just plain stupid
what the hell kind of crap be that
then there be the plot hole
you could drive a semi truck into these hole
Dee Snider just plain suck
he can not act one of the least scary villain I have ever see he can not write do he write this damn movie in he sleep
I be bore throughout the whole damn thing
the act suck the music suck the script suck the pacing suck the special fx suck the direct suck basically this movie suck
this film try to be a serious and sophisticated thriller horror flick and it fail miserably
this be probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal film I have ever see in my entire life
a piece of cinematic garbage capture on celluloid
avoid at any and all cost
at any rate this film stink its not funny and Fulci should have stay with giallo and supernatural zombie movie
avoid this film at all cost
I do not know what happen in season five what a mess
the only consistent thread hold the series together be the amazing performance of Leni Parker and Anita LaSelva as the two Taelons in quiet idealogical conflict
now this be a movie I really dislike
it be one of the most boring Horror movie from the 90's mainly because it start slow and center in a boring atmosphere
the story be lame not interesting and never really explain the sinister origin of the puppet
there be not death scene like in previous movie and the fx be terrible
I feel asleep the first time I watch it so I can recommend it for insomniac
otherwise do not even waste you time on this
this one just fail to create any real suspense
as for the killer do not expect anything original or even remotely frightening
I be so sorry but I really can not recommend it to anyone
one of the most boring pointless movie I have ever see
the secondary plot line be incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line be mystify
hate it
this be one of the worst Sandra Bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad
I do not understand how this garbage get on the shelf of the movie store it be not even a real movie
I highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash
this be not movie make
the acting be like watch wooden puppet move around and read from a book that be how bad it be
so I be here to warn you DO NOT RENT this movie it be the dumbest thing you have never see
I agree with Jessica this movie be pretty bad
the story line be totally predictable
I have see soap opera more intelligent than this movie
bad character bad story and bad act
really awful
not easy to watch
it be too bad that everyone else involve do not share Crowe's level of dedication to quality for if they do we would have a far better film on we hand than this sub par mess
the movie seem a little slow at first
if you act in such a film you should be glad that you be gon na drift away from earth as far as possible
this one want to surf on the small wave of space movie in 1998 Deep Impact and Armageddon and this one fail everywhere
if you have not choke in you own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue you have must have bore yourself to death with this waste of time
instead we get a bear fest about a whiny spoil brat babysitting
I never walk out of a movie faster
I just get bore watch Jessice Lange take she clothes off
unfortunately any virtue in this film's production work be lose on a regrettable script
in a word it be embarrassing
exceptionally bad
all in all its a insult to one's intelligence and a huge waste of money
crust be not good
not tasty and the texture be just nasty

we get the food and apparently they have never hear of salt and the batter on the fish be chewy
the service be meh
it take over 30 min to get they milkshake which be nothing more than chocolate milk
I guess I should have know that this place would suck because it be inside of the Excalibur but I do not use my common sense
the scallop dish be quite appalling for value as well
2 time very bad customer service
there be so much good food in Vegas that I feel cheat for waste a eating opportunity by go to Rice and Company

walk in and the place smell like a old grease trap and only 2 other there eat
the turkey and roast beef be bland
the pan cake everyone be rave about taste like a sugary disaster tailor to the palate of a six year old
the poor batter to meat ratio make the chicken tender very unsatisfying
in summary this be a largely disappointing dining experience
never be to Hard Rock Casino before will never ever step forward in it again

the shower area be outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you do not mind be nude for everyone to see
