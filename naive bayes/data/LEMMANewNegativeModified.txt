tie to charger for conversation last more than 45 minute major problem
if you have several dozen or several hundred contact then imagine the fun of send each of they one by one
needless to say I waste my money
what a waste of money and time
if the two be seperate by a mere 5 ft I start to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset
the design be very odd as the ear clip be not very comfortable at all
I advise everyone do NOT be FOOLED
it click into place in a way that make you wonder how long that mechanism would last
I go on Motorola's website and follow all direction but could not get it to pair again
the commercial be the most misleading
I buy it for my mother and she have a problem with the battery
I do not think that the instruction provide be helpful to I
people couldnt hear I talk and I have to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone
do not hold charge
this be a simple little phone to use but the breakage be unacceptible
it be unusable in a move car at freeway speed
I have two more year leave in this contract and I hate this phone
you need at least 3 min to get to you phone book from the time you first turn on the phone Battery life be short
Poor talk Time Performance
worthless product
I be not impress by this product
I only hear garbage for audio
who in they right mind be gon na buy this battery
after argue with VERIZON REGARDING the drop CALLS WE return the phone after two day
disappoint with battery
not loud enough and do not turn on like it should
very disappointed
the button for on and off be bad
essentially you can forget Microsoft's tech support
buy a different phone but not this
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly
the one big drawback of the mp3 player be that the button on the phone's front cover that let you pause and skip song lock out after a few seconds
a week later after I activate it it suddenly die
Mic do not work
even in my BMW 3 series which be fairly quiet I have trouble hear what the other person be say
do not buy for d807 wrongly advertise for d807
I purchase this and within 2 day it be no longer work
the battery run down quickly
this item work great but it break after 6 month of use
the construction of the headset be poor
for a product that cost as much as this one do I expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing do
the ear bud only play music in one ear
Dont waste you money
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it
I find this product to be waaay too big
I be very disappoint with my decision
Buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet
I receive my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there be not a match between the phone and the charger
that be a huge design flaw unless I be not use it correctly which I do not think be the case
the camera although rate at a impressive 13 megapixel render image that fall well below expectation of such a relatively high resolution
I purcash this for the car charger and it do not work
i get this phone around the end of may and i be completely unhappy with it
bad quality
basically the service be very bad
it do not work in my cell phone plug i be very up set with the charger
the BT headset be such a disapoinment
Buyer be very careful
the majority of the Logitech earbud headset fail
in my house I be get drop coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement
what a waste
during several different 2 minute call I experience 5 drop and it be in a area that have 5 bar
I be not happy with this item
very disappointed
the phone take forever to charge like 2 to 5 hour literally
what a waste of time
its reception be very very poor
item state as include from the description be not include
after 3 month screen just go black all of a sudden
I be hope for more
Audio Quality be poor very poor
I have buy 5 wire headphone that sound better than these
all I can do be whine on the internet so here it go the more I use the thing the less I like it
this be essentially a communication tool that do not communicate
I still maintain that monkey should not make headphone we just obviously do not share enough dna to copy the design over to human
do not work at all I bougth it for my l7c and its not work
do not last long
one thing I hate be the mode set button at the side
thank you for waste my money
how can that be the audio quality be poor
I put the latest os on it v1 15g and it now like to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while
it only recognize the phone as its storage device
if you like a loud buzz to override all you conversation then this phone be for you
do not buy this product
I have have this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fit on the ear
I have this phone and it be a thorn in my side I really abhor it
I recently have problem where I could not stay connect for more than 10 minute before be disconnect
design flaw
Waste of 13 buck
but when I check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turn off a few seconds into the first message and then I be lose
the replacement die in a few week
I have have problem wit hit drop signal and more
not impressed
bad choice
the pleather case do not fit
useless phone simply deaf
it make very strange tick noise before it end the call
battery last only a few hour
we be send it back
I do not bother contact the company for few dollar product but I learn the lesson that I should not have buy this form online anyway
if you hate earbug avoid this phone by all means
I also do not like the on button it feel like it would crack with use
WORST PHONE EVER
freeze frequently4
it be kind of embarrassing to use because of how it look and mostly it be embarrassing how child like the company be
all in all I would expect a better consumer experience from Motorola
there be a horrible tick sound in the background on all my call that I have never experience before
I be a bit disappointed
I have have this phone for over a year now and I will tell you its not that great
the battery be completely useless to I
what a big waste of time
do not waste you on this one
do not make the same mistake as I
big disappointment with calendar sync
the phone be unusable and be not new
worst customer Service ever
no additional ear gel provide and no instruction whatsoever
it defeat the purpose of a bluetooth headset
internet be excrutiatingly slow
this product have a strong rubber petroleum smell that be unbearable after a while and cause I to return it
poor quality and service
the cable look so thin and flimsy it be scary
Absolutel junk
that one do not work either
return 8 hour later
do not waste you money
not only will it drain you player but may also potentially fry it
unreliable I be give up
avoid this one if you can
I waste my little money with this earpiece
First of all it do not wear well
I would not recommend buy this product
piece of junk
poorly contstruct hinge
do not buy it
DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PHONE
customer service be terrible
battery life still not long enough in Motorola Razor v3i
send it back
as many people complain I find this headset's microphone be very weak
my 5 year old Nokia 2160 from Tracfone hold the charge a lot better than this
they do not care about the consumer one bit
the instruction manual be lack
the battery be unreliable as well as the service use antena
it be uncomfortable and the sound quality be quite poor compare with the phone Razr or with my previous wire headset that plug into a lg
I want my money back
I order this product first and be unhappy with it immediately
the ngage be still lack in earbud
I have 2 3 bar on my cell phone when I be home but you can not not hear anything
however the riingtone be not the best and neither be the game
the plug do not work very well
AMAZON suck
Rip off over charge shipping
1 long lasting battery you do not have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phone 2
obviously there be a problem with the adhesive
very disappointing
it be a inexpensive piece but I would still have expect better quality
it be practically useless and do not add any kind of boost to my reception after I buy it
be not happy
a piece of JUNK that break after be on MY PHONE for 2 day
worst customer service
reception be terrible and full of static
I be sit in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lose signal
be jerk on the phone
they network coverage in Los Angeles be horrible
excellent starter wireless headset
the loudspeaker option be great the bumper with the light be very appealing
the only thing that I think could improve be the sound leak out from the headset
first off the reception suck I have never have more than 2 bar ever
the phone get extremely hot
also if you phone be drop this case be not go to save it specially when drop face down
bad fit way too big
Waste of money
I will be drivng along and my headset start ring for no reason
the worst phone I have ever have only have it for a few month
not a good item it work for a while then start have problem in my auto reverse tape player
this be so embarassing and also my ear hurt if I try to push the ear plug into my ear
this be a very average phone with bad battery life that operate on a weak network
so yo technology suck
same problem as other have mention
the worst piece of crap ever along with the Verizon customer service
Poor sound quality
the picture resolution be far below what other comparably price phone be offer today
use all earpiece leave or right this thing will not stay on my ear
still wait I be sure this item would work well if I ever recieve it
what a disappointment
do not waste you money and time
it be so stupid to have to keep buy new charger car charger cradle headphone and car kit every time a new phone come out
I come over from Verizon because cingulair have nicer cell phone the first thing I notice be the really bad service
I will be look for a new earpiece
we receive a WHITE color battery that go dead after a couple hour the original use to last a week but still last longer than the replacement
after a year the battery go completely dead on my headset
this be the first phone I have have that have be so cheaply make
att be not clear sound be very distorted and you have to yell when you talk
the plastic break really easy on this clip
do not make the same mistake I do
oh and I forget to also mention the weird color effect it have on you phone
also the area where my unit break I be not too fond of the magnetic strap
another note about this phone's appearance be that it really look rather bland especially in the all black model
low Quality
warning Stay away
I wish I could return the unit and get back my money
I use to talk on it for 1 1 1 2 hour and the battery would be literally drain and die
if you do not find it too bad as again the unit come with one earpad only I would not recommend this to anyone
very displeased
I might have get a defect but I would not risk buy it again because of the build quality alone
they make this case too small and be very difficult to install
do not fit
there be really nothing bad I can say about this headset
I even fully charge it before I go to bed and turn off blue tooth and wi fi and notice that it only have 20 leave in the morning
I have also have problem with the phone read the memory card in which I always turn it on and then off again
not good when wear a hat or sunglass
horrible phone
battery be junk
cant get the software to work with my computer
disappoint
poor voice clarity
no buyer remorse on this one
very disappoint in AccessoryOne
I find this inexcusable and so will probably be return this phone and perhaps change carrier
the update procedure be difficult and cumbersome
disappointment I hate anything that go in my ear
uncomfortable in the ear do not use
the volume switch rocket out of the unit to a destination unknown
I would like to return it
Verizon's bill however be difficult to understand even though they pricing plan be simple
a disappointment
its not user friendly
unfortunately the ability to actually know you be receive a call be a rather important feature and this phone be pitiful
then I exchange for the same phone even that have the same problem
this result in the phone be either stick at max volume or mute
Pretty piece of junk
plug be the wrong size
save you money I have have this item for 11 month now
bad purchase
defective crap
I would have give no star if I be able
the sound quality for the device be unacceptable unless you be in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing
I would not recommend this item to anyone
the holster that arrive do not match the photo in the ad
as a earlier review note plug in this charger and nothing happen
you never know if you push it hard enough or the right number of time for the function you want or not
I be not impress with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone
my only complaint be the standard sound volume be a little low even when turn up to 5 of 5
REALLY UGLY
horrible have to switch 3 time
no real improvement
they refuse to refund or replace
unfortunately it be easy to accidentally activate they with the gentle touch button if you accidentally touch the phone to you face while listen
so I basically throw my money out the window for nothing
all it take be one drop from about 6 inch above the kitchen counter and it be crack I be not impressed and I be not laugh
none of the new one have ever quite work properly
I have miss numerous call because of this reason
perhaps my phone be defective but people can not hear I when I use this
do not buy this product
suck most of the stuff do not work with my phone
worst software ever use if I could give this zero star I would
try to make a call on these be a exercise in frustration
the case be a flimsy piece of plastic and have no front or side protection whatsoever
I give wirefly 1 star I will contact Cingular at t and inform they of this practice
it be aggravate
none of it work just do not buy it
Muddy low quality sound and the case around the wire's insert be poorly super glue and slide off
please dont waste you money
yet Plantronincs continue to use the same flawed charger design
disapoint result
cumbersome design
it be a piece of crap
my experience be terrible this be my fourth bluetooth headset and while it be much more comfortable than my last Jabra which I hate
worst ever
I can barely ever hear on it and be constantly say what
the battery life be highly unacceptable
that company be a joke
due to this happen on every call I be force to stop use this headset
Verizon tech support walk my through a few procedure none of which work and I end up have to do a hard re set wipe out all my datum
Voice Quality Signal strength drop call
it feel poorly construct the menu be difficult to navigate and the button be so recess that it be difficult to push they
also difficult to put on I would recommend avoid this product
I only use it two day and it be not always easy to hear with
I get the car charger and not even after a week the charger be break I go to plug it in and it start smoking
Sprint terrible customer service
what possese I to get this junk I have no idea

the real killer be the volume and of course it break
Poor Construction
this be infuriate
Sprint charge for this service
it be cheap and it feel and look just as cheap
it do not work in Europe or Asia
the worst phone from samsung crap this crappy Samsung e715 be the worst i have ever seeen
the charger work for about a week and then completely stop charge my phone
Poor product
however I need some better instruction
you need two hand to operate the screen this software interface be decade old and can not compete with new software design
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine Palm replacementr pen which come in a three pack
DO NOT BUY DO NOT BUYIT suck
plus I seriously do not believe it be worth its steep price point
very dissapointing Performance
do not make the same mistake that I do and please do not buy this phone
this phone might well be the worst I have ever have in any brand
case be more or less a extra that I originally put on but later discard because it scratch my ear
do not bother go to the store
however BT headset be currently not good for real time game like first person shooter since the audio delay mess I up
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer
perform awful muffle tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for
I contact the company and they tell I that although the unit be still under warranty if I could not produce my receipt I be out of luck
linksy should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something
when I place my treo into the case not only be it not snug but there be a lot of extra room on the side
battery be terrible
the earpiece on this be too large or too heavy it keep fall out of my ear
Utter crap sound quality be terrible
the charger arrive within the promise timeframe but it do not work
finally after three or four time the spring of the latch break and I could not use it any longer on the visor
talk about useless customer service
it feel too light and tinny
this do not fit the Palm Tungsten e2 and it break the first time I try to plug it in
I could not recommend these more
look good in the picture but this case be a huge disappointment
its extremely slow and take forever to do anything with it
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sin of industrial design
the first thing that happen be that the tracking be off
then I have to continue pair it periodically since it somehow keep drop
ca not upload ringtone from a third party
Bluetooth do not work phone lock up screen just flash up and now it just make call randomly while in my pocket lock
truly awful
and none of the tone be acceptable
camera color balance be AWFUL
this product be clearly not ready for prime time I do not care how cool it look if you can not tell a call be come in it be worthless
chinese forgery abound
the instruction do not explain that a microphone jack could be use
i would advise to not purchase this item it never work very well
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service
the nokia CA 42 usb cable do not work with my phone
the biggest complaint I have be the battery drain superfast
the design might be ergonomic in theory but I could not stand have these in my ear
do NOT buy if you want to use the holster
it do not make you look cool
also the phone do not seem to accept anything except CBR mp3 preferably rip by Windows Media Player
so just beware
so anyone near you will hear part of you conversation
I buy this phone as a replacement for my StarTac and have regret it since
ca not store anything but phone number to SIM
it last less than 3o minute if I actually try to use the phone my wife have the same phone with the same problem
Poor quality
not worth it
the phone crash completely and now I have to get it replace
unfortunately it will not recharge my iPhone 4 despite connect it from multiple power source iMac external battery wall outlet etc
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bell whistle be mediocre
think it over when you plan to own this one this sure be the last moto phone for I
after receive and use the product for just 2 day it break
none of the three size they send with the headset would stay in my ear
we have try 2 unit and they both fail within 2 month pro

I get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phone I have not have this problem
after my phone get to be about a year old it be be slowly break despite much care on my part
I be sorry I make this purchase
I buy these hope I could make my Bluetooth headset fit better but these thing make it impossible to wear
Treo and t Mobile refuse to replace it again and force I to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount
it be horrible
I do not think it would hold it too securly on you belt
this allow the possibility of double book for the same date and time after the first

I can not use this case because the smell be disgust
NOT what I want

my phone sound ok not great ok but my wife's phone be almost totally unintelligible she could not understand a word be say on it
so I have to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it
while I manage to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now have enough stress that it will break on the next drop
saggy floppy piece of junk
it also have a new problem

earbud piece break easily
lousy product
this phone try very hard to do everything but fail at it be very ability to be a phone

Echo Problem very unsatisfactory

do not waste you money
I be go to have to be the first to negatively review this product

you also can not take picture with it in the case because the lense be cover
phone fall out easily
it do not work people can not hear I when I talk
the text messaging feature be really tricky to use
I be really disappointed all I have now be a charger that do not work
painful on the ear
last one day and then blow up
disappointed
Kind of flop around
the screen do get smudge easily because it touch you ear and face
what a piece of junk I lose more call on this phone
Item do not Match Picture
the only thing that disappoint I be the infra red port irda
you can not answer call with the unit never work once
a very very very slow move aimless movie about a distressed drift young man
not sure who be more lose the flat character or the audience nearly half of whom walk out
attempt artiness with black white and clever camera angle the movie disappointed become even more ridiculous as the acting be poor and the plot and line almost non existent
very little music or anything to speak of
the rest of the movie lack art charm meaning if it be about emptiness it work I guess because it be empty
waste two hour
a bit predictable
it have some average act from the main person and it be a low budget as you clearly can see
this short film certainly pull no punch
Graphics be far from the best part of the game
today the graphic be crap
this be a flick doom from its conception
the very idea of it be lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg 13 film and make a complete non sequel while change its tone to a pg rate family movie
I be not the least bit interested
not only do it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also manage to give away the entire movie and I be not exaggerate every moment every plot point every joke be tell in the trailer
but it be just not funny
but even the talented Carrell can not save this
he co star do not fare much better with people like Morgan Freeman Jonah Hill and Ed Helms just waste
the story itself be just predictable and lazy
the only real effect work be the presence of all the animal and the integration of those into the scene be some of the worst and most obvious blue green screen work I have ever see
but whatever it be that cost they so much it do not translate to quality that be for sure
on the negative it be insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hour of life waste in front of the screen
long whiny and pointless
but I recommend wait for they future effort let this one go
I be very disappointed in the movie
one character be totally annoying with a voice that give I the feeling of fingernail on a chalkboard
there be a totally unnecessary train roller coaster scene
there be absolutely no warmth or charm to these scene or character
this movie totally grate on my nerve
the performance be not improve by improvisation because the actor now have twice as much to worry about not only whether they be deliver the line well but whether the line itself be any good
and quite honestly often its not very good
often the dialogue do not really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings
it crackle with a unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i find it hard to follow and concentrate on it meander so badly
I would not say they be worth 2 hour of you time though
I be glad this pretentious piece of s do not do as plan by the Dodge stratus Big Shots it be gon na help movie maker who be not in the very restrained movie business of Qu bec
the problem be the script
it be horrendous
there be nothing believable about it at all
the only suspense I be feeling be the frustration at just how retard the girl be
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it be kind of embarrassing to watch Lane and Gere in this film because it be bad
the acting be bad the dialog be extremely shallow and insincere
it be too predictable even for a chick flick
too politically correct
very disappointing
I love Lane but I have never see she in a movie this lousy
a hour and a half I wish I could bring back
the movie be so boring that I sometimes find myself occupy peak in the paper instead of watch never happen during a Columbo movie before
and sometimes it be so embarrassing that I have to look away
the directing seem too pretentious
the scene with the oh so mature neighbour girl be a misplace
and generally the line and plot be weaker than the average episode
then scene where they debate whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely be accuse for the murder be pure horror really stupid
my only problem be I think the actor play the villain be a low rent Michael Ironside
however this do not make up for the fact that overall this be a tremendously boring movie
there be no chemistry between Ben Affleck and Sandra Bullock in this film and I could not understand why he would consider even leave he wife to be for this chick that he supposedly be knock out by
there be several moment in the movie that just do not need to be there and be excruciatingly slow move
this be a poor remake of my best Friends wedding
all in all a great disappointment
I can not believe that the actor agree to do this film
I could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of lose I Q
I guess that nobody at the network that air this dribble watch it before put it on
IMDB rating only go as low 1 for awful it be time to get some negative number in there for case such as these
I see Mirrormask last night and it be a unsatisfactory experience
unfortunately inexperience of direction mean that scene after scene pass with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict
these be the central theme of the film and they be handle ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination
all the pretty picture in the world can not make up for a piece of work that be flaw at the core
it be a hour and half waste of time follow a bunch of very pretty high schooler whine and cry about life
you can not relate with they hell you barely can understand they
this movie be a pure disaster the story be stupid and the editing be the worst I have see it confuse you incredibly
the fish be badly make and some of its underwater shot be repeat a thousand time in the film
a truly truly bad film
the acting be terrible and the writing be worse
the only possible way this movie could be redeem would be as mst3k fodder
I pay too much
it be so boring
no plot whatsoever
again no plot at all
horrible
worst hour and a half of my life oh my gosh
I hate movie like that
yeah the movie pretty much suck
there be no plot or storyline
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriend boyfriend to keep you occupy through out
awful
I do not think I have ever go to a movie and dislike it as much
nobody identify with these character because they be all cardboard cutout and stereotype or predictably reverse stereotype
this be a bad film with bad writing and good actor a ugly cartoon craft by Paul Haggis for people who can not handle anything but the bold stroke in storytelling a picture paint with crayon
Crash be a depressing little nothing that provoke emotion but teach you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice be bad thing
you brain will attempt to shut down as part of a primal impulse of self preservation
I be leave shatter from the experience of watch this ` film ' and I take a good two hour to fully recover
this movie now join revenge of the Boogeyman and Zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror film
I mean this in a terrible way
this film have no redeeming feature
everything be appalling
artless camera work endlessly present we with the ugliest setting imaginable i e
the story be beyond stupid
the script be be there a script
the kid be annoy
the lead man be charisma free
utterly without merit on any level this be akin to torture
I will even say it again this be torture
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity
not a pleasant voyage of self discovery
highly unrecommended
if this premise sound stupid that be because it be
yes it be that bad
nothing at all to recommend
this movie suffer because of the write it need more suspense
there be too many close up
but other than that the movie seem to drag and the hero do not really work for they freedom
but this movie be definitely a below average rent
this movie be bad
so bad
the film be way too long
this be definitely one of the bad one
I really do not see how anyone could enjoy this movie
I do not think I have ever see a movie half as boring as this self indulgent piece of junk
it probably would have be better if the director have not spend most of the movie showcase he own art work which really be not that noteworthy
another thing I do not really like be when a character get punch in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after
ironically I mostly find he film a total waste of time to watch
it be this pandering to the audience that sabotage most of he film
hence the whole story lack a certain energy
the plot simply rumble on like a machine desperately depend on the addition of new scene
there be the usual hitchcock logic flaw
Mishima be extremely uninteresting
this be a chilly unremarkable movie about a author living work in a chilly abstruse culture
the flat reenactment do not hold you attention because they be emotionally adrift and stagy
and the rest of it just sit there be awful with soldier sing song about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitt about purity the admiration of sword etc
he can bear you to piece and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else
Schrader have make a resume full of lousy amateurish film
however I recently watch the whole thing again on dvd and I be completely strike by how extremely stupid the storyline be how it contain hole inconsistency and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing be
I mean in a realistic world she would never have get into that ballet repertory the whole thing be quite pathetic
the character development also lack in depth
woa talk about awful
do not waste you time
it be just too horrible
the worst sappiest dialogue I could go on and on
but what really make it unwatchable be the direction
the poor actor
you can not even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic line to speak but the director give they no action
if you check the director's filmography on this site you will see why this film do not have a chance
regrettably the film fail
the movie lack visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underline the narrative
no actress have be worse use that June Allison in this movie
unfortunately this be a bad movie that be just plain bad
bad script bad direction and horrible act make this one plain bad
the dialogue suck
the cinematography if it can be call that suck
the soundtrack suck
the act suck
the concert sequence just suck
overall this movie be cheap trash
but this movie be not funny consider the ridiculousness of it
I come out of it feel angry
I be not sure what he be try to do with this film
if it be to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memory than I guess he succeed
it be force like everything in this movie
again lame
here's where the movie really pi ed I off
when I see it in the theater I think I be go to be sick
Summary The witticism be not witty
the plot well I say I would let that one go
the acting be bad
really bad
even Billy Bob could not rise above the script which be worse
camerawork again bad
Rating 1 out of 10
I literally vomit while watch this film
I be translate movie for a living and this be the first movie in my 5 year work experience that I find offensive to my intelligence
but when someone strive for greatness and poetry but deliver a muddle and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scene pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately define as pretentious crap
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful I can only say it be you intelligence and you imagination you obviously use to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt it be in we human nature to try and make sense of thing
one more thing I can tolerate political incorrectness very well I be all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character be just too much
which have more depth and character than the man underneath it
the Malta setting be as dry and as barren as the dialogue
this movie be terrible
the hockey scene be terrible defenseman play like they be 5 year old goalie diving at shot that be 10 foot wide of the net etc
for those that have not see it do not waste you time
to call this movie a drama be ridiculous
start watch this but do not believe in any of the character
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just do not work for I at all
it be a very superficial movie and it give I the feeling that I be watch play rather than a film
by the time the pyromaniac waylay the assistant I be bore and do not care what happen next and so I switch off
glad I do not pay to see it
do not laugh or even smile once
but it be not anything at all just one big yawn
but storm trooper be not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movie
it be just lame
the guy who say he be have better dialogue with he potted plant have it right
everything about this movie be stupid
even if you love bad movie do not watch this movie
it be shameful
the new character be not all that memorable and I find myself forget who be who
I feel as though she go to Ireland do absolutely nothing whatsoever
it do not make I scared horrify or make I sympathetic towards the character it be simply annoying
the jerky camera movement be also annoying
the plot be the same as pretty much every other cheap horror
there be a few pathetic attempt to give the character some depth but it do not really work into the rest of the plot
I guess it be suppose to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it be just stupid
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf
this totally unfunny movie be so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minute of utter torture I probably look at my watch about 70000 time
Lucy Bell be so much higher than this crap and for she to sink this low be quite depressing
all this movie do be make you sick watch all these slacker make excuse for they stupid action for 90 minute
God and I can never get that 90 minute back
almost all of the song in Cover Girl be old fashion and not very tuneful
the most annoying thing about ` Cover Girl ' be the way in which Rita Hayworth be put up on a pedestal
unfortunately ` Cover Girl ' be a example of how Hollywood use to exploit woman for financial gain
I could not take they seriously
I be a fan of he this movie suck really bad
even worse than Ticker
that movie be bad
only like 3 or 4 building use a couple of location maybe poor hummh
it just blow
now we be choose to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda
this show be make for Americans it be too stupid and full with hatred and clich s to be admit elsewhere
almost everyone involve must be return to school acting be utterly predictable and bad script be pile of garbage all round
I wish I could enter negative value admin
the set be so bad they would not look out of place on a Thunderbirds episode
the use of slow motion needlessly repeat itself throughout the movie but be well back up by bad act and bad be a kind word here no continuity scene that be throw in for no reason whatsoever vehicle that look like they be make from a Corn Flakes box and a directorial style that border on stupidity
oh yeah and the storyline be pathetic too
I hate write bad review about film especially those in which I really like the star but this film be so bad I do not believe for one second that anyone could have be proud of it
I be not a filmmaker nor be I a director but I would hide my head in the sand if I would spend whatever amount of money and time on this movie
in short this be a monumental waste of time and energy and I would not recommend anyone to ever see this film
it come free with a dvd player I buy but I still turn the thing off halfway through because I be embarrass for Howell
1 10 and only because there be no setting for 0 10
but the act even that of such professional as Drago and Debbie Rochon be terrible the direct worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimp like and the camera work barely tolerable
yes I be simplify thing here for the sake of brevity for this really be at the core of the problem with this film it have too much go on without any real fulfil explanation
but the convoluted plot just do not convince I and much of the film be watch with a weird question glance
I let my girlfriend talk I into see this bad idea we both hate it
Bela Lugosi be totally extraneous intone odd line
the acting be decidely wooden though no worse than a period Universal B movie
wow what a bad film
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible
the plot do not hang together at all and the acting be absolutely appalling
I be not expect Oscar material but this
you would have to have the IQ of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one come
this film and I use that word loosely be a insult to the movie go public
if only someone involve with it know how to string together narrative
this get a 1 out of 10 simply because there be nothing lower
this be one I do not have but I watch it recently on Fox Movie Channel and be very disappointed
I know he be a contract player with little control over he script but the acting be as bad as the script
Victor McLaglen be even bad and Brian DonLevy be almost unrecognizable
consider the relation off screen between Taylor and Stanwyck it be surprising how little chemistry there be on screen between the two of they
but the premise of the film be so ridiculous that the President of the U S
the death row scene be entirely unmoving
the only thing worse than Taylor's acting be Stanwyck's singing
whatever the producer be go for he miss entirely
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lot of underbite style stoic emoting think Chow Yun Fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clich s throw into a abandon factory ready for a few poorly execute fly judo roll a la John Woo
even the squib look awful
at no point in the proceedings do it look remotely like America
the plot such as it be be so derivative and predictable that the end be like a mercy killing
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who get shot top off a real waste of space and time
I be very uneasy with how bad this movie be but not scare at all
the dialogue be compose of thing that make little sense
about 30 minute of footage be waste to show mediocre elderly actor awkwardly babble overwrought pseudo satanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen Goth blush almost always in Olde English and sometimes in Latin that may or may not be make up word
the directing be sloppy at best
hackneyed write certainly but make even worse by the bad directing
of course the acting be blah
the act by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underact
and finally after all that we get to a end that would have be great have it be handle by competent people and not Jerry Falwell
I particularly remember my sens be assault by strident cord of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning
it be just the sort of pap that be screen in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not have job
about ten minute into this film I start have second thought
about half way through this film I start to dislike it
by the time the film end I not only dislike it I despise it
what this film lack be a convincing script
the script look as if only a rough draft be write and shooting begin before a finish script be complete
thing happen character personality change plot twist occur for no real reason other than that script call for it
this be probably the most irritating show I have ever see in my entire life
it be indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show I have ever see
everything about it be just bad
I could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season
the script be bad very bad it contain both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rate r or nc 17 movie
the casting be also horrible cause all you see be a really really bad actor period
final word this show be a real torture
it be zillion time away from reality
watch wash machine twirl around would not hurt you eye as much as this show
Rating 0 10 Grade z note the show be so bad that even mother of the cast Pull she Daughter out of the show
20th Century Fox's road HOUSE 1948 be not only quite a silly noir but be a implausible unmitigated bear of a movie
full of unconvincing cardboard character it be blandly write by Edward Chodorov who also produce and be surprisingly direct by Jean Negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more
from here on the Widmark character turn unintentionally comical
he lose he marble so early in the proceedings be totally implausible and unconvincing
and if that be not enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture be also mar with a constant use of studio set and indoor exterior
whatever prompt such a documentary be beyond I
very serious spoiler this movie be a huge disappointment
there be so many problem i dont know where to start
but the movie make a lot of serious mistake
first of all there be enough racial stereotype and racial joke to offend everyone
the movie be litter with overt racial slur towards the black cast member and in return the whites be depict as moron and boob
put the race card aside let look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifa's character
there be no real plot
i wouldnt see this movie again for free
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a Luv's diaper commercial be completely unconvincing
I be terribly disappoint that this film would receive so many award and accolade especially when there be far more deserving work of film out there
I do not think there be any redeeming quality in this remake
this may be the only bad film he ever make
so bad well it be just bad
this movie be a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way
it be a shame to see good actor like Thomerson and James make a living in a mess
I think it be bad
both film be terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it be watchable
let's start with all the problem the acting especially from the lead professor be very very bad
the script be a big flawed mess
the best example of how dumb the writing be when it be establish that you can turn the zombie student back into human by remove a necklace contain a piece of the meteorite
Director Paul Matthews who also write direct the weak 1995 monster movie Grim clearly do not know how to pace he film
the movie be terribly boring in place
the lighting be awful
the film look cheap and bland
one of the most disappointing aspect be the lack of notable gore
this convention never work well in the past and certainly do not work here
the visual effect be AWFUL
the explosion of the gas tank at the end be just as awful
to sum the film up breeder be a terrible cheaply make horror movie that should be avoid like the ebola virus
not recommend
he be almost unbearable to watch on screen he have little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing
aside from it be terrible lead this film have load of other debit
I understand that it be suppose to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that do not mean that it have to completely insult we intelligence and have write so incredibly hackneyed that it border on offensive
Lewis Black's considerable talent be waste here too as he be at he most incendiary when he be unrestrained which the pg 13 rating certainly will not allow
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spend this remake have little else to offer
the budget be evidently very limited
this be reflect not only in the cast but also in the below par script which borrow much from the earlier classic
however here there be no decent act action or location work to balance thing up
filmie be less expansive
it fail to convey the broad sweep of landscape that be a great part of the original
generally it just lack imagination
not recommend
be it possible for a movie to get any worse than this
there be no plot here to keep you go in the first place
even when the woman finally show up there be no sign of improvement the most expect thing happen and by the time the film be over you might be far asleep
beware this be not a trashy cult movie this be trash period
I can not believe there be even a sequel to this
which be precisely why I be give it such a bad review
every element of this story be so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it be painful to sit through
she line seem to have be write by a fifteen year old though they be try oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk
there be simply no excuse for something this poorly do
I see this movie and I think this be a stupid movie
what be even more stupid be that who have think a idea that there should be a volcano in Los Angeles
to be honest with you this be unbelievable nonsense and very foolish
in conclusion I will not bother with this movie because a volcano in Los Angeles be nothing but nonsense
the story line be just awful
it be just painful
and the accent be absolutely abysmal
there be also enough hypocrisy in this film to make I vomit
do not waste you time watch this rubbish non research film
omit watch this
my rating just 3 out of 10
the basic premise be waste since it be sideline by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew
regardless the film fail on most level
avoid at all cost
I know that Jim O'Connor be very energetic and that nobody could be as much as he but George be well dull
he really do not seem to want to be host he voice over be monotonous
this movie be so mind bendingly awful it could not have even be create
the film lack any real scare or tension some of the medical terminology use throughout be a bit iffy to say the least I say that as a insulin dependant diabetic myself
the least say about the act the better
even allow for poor production value for the time 1971 and the format some kind of mini series this be baaaaaad
unless you be just out to visually collect all extant film of Austen's work you can skip this one
it be not good
speak of the music it be unbearably predictably and kitchy
then the film just drop the ball
there be many continuity error one other user comment on different car in the garage Joe's glass the one that get to I the most be the fact Joe's facial hair configuration seem to change from scene to scene
I can not see how this movie can be a inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection
it be so bad it be actually worth see just for that reason
well just if you keep think how bad it be
it be a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage
it be a case of ` so bad it be laughable '
very bad performance play Angela Bennett a computer expert who be at home all the time
it be a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scene
how awful she be
but she be still a bad actress repeat she robotic face move in each of she picture
the result well be a shame
delete this film from you mind
one of the worst show of all time
the show would begin with smart ass ed comment to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for
the fat computer geek be unbelievable the bible thumper the bad ass girl who be these actor
never hear of any of they except Cole who be totally unbelievable in the part
every time he open he mouth you expect to hear you see kid pull the plug be a mercy killing for this horrible show
the story be as unbelievable as the actor
lame would be the best way to describe it
im big fan of RPG game too but this movie its a disgrace to any self respect rpger there be

that be how I would describe this painfully dreary time waster of a film
so mediocre in every aspect that it just become a dull uninteresting mess this be one of the most forgettable movie I have see
it be a empty hollow shell of a movie
seriously it be not worth waste you or you kid's time on
avoid avoid avoid
it will drive you bark mad
nothing new there
that be do in the second movie
the movie have almost no action scene in it and very little comedy
the plot have more hole than a pair of fishnet stocking and the direction and editing be astonishingly ham fist
what on earth be Irons do in this film
the football scene at the end be perplexing
this scene be very strong and unpleasant
and it be bore
I be so tired of clich s that be just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast
why be this film make
the film have a ultra cheap look to it
the result be a film that just do not look right
none of they be engage or exciting
the plot be nonsense that do not interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it
the Foreigner be not worth one second of you time
how this piece of trash be ever release be beyond I the act the story the character the supposedly special effect etc it be all wrong
avoid at all cost
Star Trek V The final Frontier be the worst in the series
the act from all involve and that include those like Shatner and Nimoy be bad and wash out and make they seem as old as they look in real life the special effect be tacky like when Spock have to rescue Kirk on a jet pack when he fall down from a mountain
the attempt at humor be pitiful and story be so awful it dose not bear think about which basically involve a Vulcan steal the enterprise to find god seriously I just do not care about any of this film and oh not to mention Uhura do a belly dance to distract male guard
the worst one of the series
very disappointed and wonder how it could be in the Oscar shortlist
it be very slow
lot of hole in the plot there be nothing about how he become the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 year between he childhood and mature age
do not waste you time
end of day be one of the worst big budget action movie I have ever see
he surely do not know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of Air Force one who be only oblige to write the script just for a big sum of money

I be still try to get over how bad it be
lot of hole in the script
now imagine that every single one of those decision be make wrong
the dialogue be atrocious
the acting be beyond abysmal
everything stink
worse there be a incredibly weak sub plot throw in that follow a little band of latter day mansonite as they go after a reporter who be work on a story on the anniversary of the killing
it be dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time
in short do not bother with this movie
also the story and act be weak
at around 4 pm I buy it at around 8pm I start to watch at around 8 15pm I fast forward the remain film to see if there be anything left watchable for a human be with a brain but there be not
either way it suck
the script be horrendously stupid

this film try to be a serious and sophisticated thriller horror flick and it fail miserably
this be probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal film I have ever see in my entire life
a piece of cinematic garbage capture on celluloid
avoid at any and all cost
at any rate this film stink its not funny and Fulci should have stay with giallo and supernatural zombie movie
avoid this film at all cost
I do not know what happen in season five what a mess
the only consistent thread hold the series together be the amazing performance of Leni Parker and Anita LaSelva as the two Taelons in quiet idealogical conflict
now this be a movie I really dislike
it be one of the most boring Horror movie from the 90's mainly because it start slow and center in a boring atmosphere
the story be lame not interesting and never really explain the sinister origin of the puppet
there be not death scene like in previous movie and the fx be terrible
I feel asleep the first time I watch it so I can recommend it for insomniac
otherwise do not even waste you time on this
this one just fail to create any real suspense
as for the killer do not expect anything original or even remotely frightening
I be so sorry but I really can not recommend it to anyone
one of the most boring pointless movie I have ever see
the secondary plot line be incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line be mystify

the movie seem a little slow at first
if you act in such a film you should be glad that you be gon na drift away from earth as far as possible
this one want to surf on the small wave of space movie in 1998 Deep Impact and Armageddon and this one fail everywhere
if you have not choke in you own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue you have must have bore yourself to death with this waste of time
instead we get a bear fest about a whiny spoil brat babysitting
I never walk out of a movie faster
I just get bore watch Jessice Lange take she clothes off

the chip that come out be drip with grease and mostly not edible
I be not really impressed with Strip Steak

the place be not clean and the food oh so stale
but the service be beyond bad
taste like dirt
my sashimi be poor quality be soggy and tasteless

once you food arrive it be meh

my brother in law who work at the mall eat here same day and guess what he be sick all night too
mediocre food
I be super pissd
why be these sad little vegetable so overcooked
I have high hope for this place since the burger be cook over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fall flat way flat
not a single employee come out to see if we be ok or even need a water refill once they finally serve we we food
the server be very negligent of we need and make we feel very unwelcome I would not suggest this place
the service be terrible though
this place be overprice not consistent with they boba and it really be overprice

for that price I can think of a few place I would have much rather go
the service here be fair at best
I do love sushi but I find Kabuki to be over price over hip and under service
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish
very poor service
no one at the table think the food be above average or worth the wait that we have for it
I pay the bill but do not tip because I feel the server do a terrible job
I have never have such bland food which surprise I consider the article we read focus so much on they spice and flavor
Food be way overpriced and portion be fuck small
for 40 buck a head i really expect better food
I will not be back
we could not believe how dirty the oyster be
this place deserve no star
I would not recommend this place

I probably would not go here again

hot dish be not hot cold dish be close to room temp I watch staff prepare food with bare hand no glove everything be deep fry in oil
the feel of the dining room be more college cooking course than high class dining and the service be slow at best
I start this review with two star but I be editing it to give it only one
this be the worst sushi i have ever eat besides Costco's
weird vibe from owner
there be hardly any meat
I have have better bagel from the grocery store
I find a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa
the service be terrible food be mediocre
on three different occasion I ask for well do or medium well and all three time I get the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate
I have about two bite and refuse to eat anymore
the service be extremely slow
after 20 minute wait I get a table
no allergy warning on the menu and the waitress have absolutely no clue as to which meal do or do not contain peanut
pricing be a bit of a concern at Mellow Mushroom
worst Thai ever
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron
spend you money elsewhere
the Buffet at Bellagio be far from what I anticipate
and the drink be weak people
my order be not correct
after the disappointing dinner we go elsewhere for dessert
we will not be return
I seriously can not believe that the owner have so many unexperienced employee that all be run around like chicken with they head cut off
very very sad
i feel insult and disrespect how could you talk and judge another human be like that
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you can not properly cook a steak I do not understand
I be not impress with the concept or the food
the only thing I be not too crazy about be they guacamole as I do not like it pur ed
there be really nothing for I at postino hope you experience be better
I get food poisoning here at the buffet
they bring a fresh batch of fries and I be think yay something warm but no
what should have be a hilarious yummy Christmas Eve dinner to remember be the biggest fail of the entire trip for we
needless to say I will not be go back anytime soon
this place be disgust
the ri style calamari be a joke
however there be so much garlic in the fondue it be barely edible
I could barely stomach the meal but do not complain because it be a business lunch
it be so bad I have lose the heart to finish it
it also take she forever to bring we the check when we ask for it
we be not one to make a scene at restaurant but I just do not get it definitely lose the love after this one
disappointing experience
the food be about on par with Denny's which be to say not good at all
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this be the place for you
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rate be all I be say
we will not be go back
the place be fairly clean but the food simply be not worth it
this place lack style
the sangria be about half of a glass wine full and be 12 ridiculous
do not bother come here
the meat be pretty dry I have the sliced brisket and pull pork
the building itself seem pretty neat the bathroom be pretty trippy but I would not eat here again
it be equally awful
probably not in a hurry to go back
very slow at seat even with reservation
not good by any stretch of the imagination
the cashew cream sauce be bland and the vegetable be undercooked
the chipolte ranch dip sause be tasteless seem thin and water down with no heat
it be a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lack flavor
I be very disappointed
this place be horrible and way overprice
maybe it be just they vegetarian fare but I have be twice and I think it be average at best
it be not busy at all and now we know why
the table outside be also dirty a lot of the time and the worker be not always friendly and helpful with the menu
the ambiance here do not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuit
con spotty service
the fries be not hot and neither be my burger
but then they come back cold
then we food come out disappointment ensue
the real disappointment be we waiter
my husband say she be very rude do not even apologize for the bad food or anything
insult profound deuchebaggery and have to go outside for a smoke break while serve just to solidify it
if someone order two taco do not ' you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it be combo or ala cart
she be quite disappointed although some blame need to be place at she door
after all the rave review I could not wait to eat here what a disappointment
Del Taco be pretty nasty and should be avoid if possible
it be not hard to make a decent hamburger
Hell no will I go back
we have have get a much better service from the pizza place next door than the service we receive from this restaurant
I do not know what the big deal be about this place but I will not be back ya'all
I immediately say I want to talk to the manager but I do not want to talk to the guy who be do shot of fireball behind the bar
the ambiance be not much better
unfortunately it only set we up for disapppointment with we entree

it lack flavor seem undercooked and dry
it really be impressive that the place have not close down
I would avoid this place if you be stay in the Mirage

I can not tell you how disappointed I be
I think food should have flavor and texture and both be lack
appetite instantly go
